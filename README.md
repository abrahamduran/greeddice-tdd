# GreedDice TDD
  
In this repo you will find the code written during my time practicing TDD.
Here are some useful links about the kata I followed, the game, and TDD in general.

### Cyclomatic Complexity

Here we have the cyclomatic complexity scored by the `score` function. The versions listed match the tag associated with the corresponding commit.

| Version | Complexity |
| ------- | ------ |
| v1 | 6 |
| v2 | 2 |

With the v2 tag we introduced three more functions, here you can look at the cyclomatic complexity for each of them.

| Function | Complexity |
| ------- | ------ |
| score | 2 |
| scoreForSingles | 2 |
| scoreIfTripleExists | 3 |
| scoreForTriples | 2 |
